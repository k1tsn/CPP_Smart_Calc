## Smart calculator

### Calculator
Evaluates expressions. Supports scientific notation and implicit multiplication. If the expression is incorrect, an error is displayed in a special block.

### Charts
The minimum and maximum x/y are the limits of the graph axes. The minimum and maximum must have the same absolute value. When x ranges from -100 to 100, the graph will be plotted, but when x ranges from 0 to 100, it will not. Step in x and y - calculated indicators.

### Credit calculator
Displays a table of monthly payments. If the input data is incorrect (negative), the calculation will not be performed.

### Deposit calculator
Displays a table of payments for certain periods. Supports withdrawals and deposits.
It works with an error - it calculates the tax incorrectly.
